### "Bare hands", using Git and Python3 -- on (Linux, macOS, and Android [via Termux])
1. Clone this repository on your local machine and `cd` (or `chdir`, anti bloat guy) to it
2. Set up Python virtual environment named "venv" inside it (Requires `virtualenv` installed on the system)
  - `virtualenv venv`
  - Don't forget to activate the virtualenv: `. venv/bin/activate`
3. Set up database for the userbot, search Google on how to set up a local database (PostgreSQL is recommended)
4. Install the requirements: `pip3 install -r ./requirements.txt`
5. Edit `sample_config.env` and save it as `config.env`
  - Do not forget to fill in the `REQUIRED %%` values, or else the bot will not run
6. Run the bot: `bash ./exec.sh`
  - Protip: See what `bash ./exec.sh --help` tells you

### Docker
1. Clone this repository on your local machine and `cd` (or `chdir`, anti bloat guy) to it
2. Edit `sample_config.env` and save it as `config.env`
  - Set `DATABASE_URL` to `postgresql://USERNAME:PASSWORD@db:5432/weebproject`
  - You should set `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` too in `docker-compose.yml`
  - Do not forget to fill in the `REQUIRED %%` values, or else the bot will not run
3. Run docker: `docker-compose up`

##### â€» Those steps are probably possible to pull off on Windows but it's pretty much unknown (different file tree paradigm, directory conventions, PowerShell instead of BASH or ZSH) -- If you're on Windows, you'd be better off running this on WSL (or WSL2)
